## Linear Attack Suite for Simple Feistel Networks

This repository contains procedures to attack a general balanced Feistel network with variable number of S-Boxes and
generic permutation layers before S-Boxes.

## TO-DO
- Add possible breaks to inactive s-boxes.
- Update Feistel structures for assymetric-ness.
- Possible expansion to the key-schedule mechanism.
- Parallelise, Parallelise, Parallelise.
